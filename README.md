_Bigger, Bolder, Beatable!_

### This is an UNOFFICIAL mod for Unbeatable Demo that lets you play and create custom beatmaps.

Custom Beatmaps Mod for UNBEATABLE Demo `V1.5.28` with ONLINE mode and HIGH SCORES _(this time for real!)_

**[Visit our Discord](https://discord.gg/XzqMhRMmhC)**


# Features
- Play custom Beatmaps either locally or from our discord community!
- Test your Beatmaps directly from their OSU directory without uploads or conversions
- High (and low) scores for both Custom Beatmaps AND UNBEATABLE Demo official beatmaps
- Upload your existing white label scores

# Installation

0) Make sure UNBEATABLE Demo is up to date and patched to the current version
1) [Download the latest release of the mod](https://github.com/TacoDogUnbeatableThing/CustomBeatmapsV3/releases)
2) Locate UNBEATABLE's game files (Steam Instructions. For Itch just open the game installation folder)
    1) Locate `UNBEATABLE Demo` in your Steam Library
    2) Right click `UNBEATABLE Demo` and click `Properties`
    3) In the open panel, navigate to `LOCAL FILES`
    4) In the `LOCAL FILES` page, click `Browse...`
3) If you downloaded the old mod (CustomBeatmapsV2), there is no need for conversions, everything should work as it did before!
4) If you downloaded the REALLY old mod (CustomBeatmapsV1), rename `USER_BEATMAPS` to `USER_PACKAGES`
5) Drag and drop the contents of the mod's zip file directly into the Unbeatable game directory (same directory as `UNBEATABLE Demo.exe`)

6) Open the game. If the mod was installed correctly, a `Custom Beatmaps` button will appear in the song select menu

# Making Custom Beatmaps

1) The best way is to use OSU's built in editor. I highly suggest taking a look at [Ratismal's Original Beatmap tutorial](https://github.com/Ratismal/CustomBeats/blob/master/creation.md), made way before even CustomBeatmapsV1.

2) To test your beatmap, open the `OSU!` tab and find your beatmap there (should be at the top). Inside the edit view you can pause, make changes in OSU, save the OSU file and the beatmap will auto-reload in UNBEATABLE (as in, your changes will appear in UNBEATABLE right before your very eyes!)

# Uploading Custom Beatmaps

1) In the CustomBeatmaps screen, Open the `OSU!` tab and select your beatmap
2) Press `EXPORT`
3) Check the `UNBEATABLE Demo` game directory for a zip file of your beatmap
4) Upload this beatmap to the [discord server](https://discord.gg/XzqMhRMmhC)'s #beatmap-verify channel. A mod will take a look, once your beatmap is approved & uploaded it will appear in the online view!

Screenshot from v3 but it's similar enough

# Known Issues

- The online packages screen is a bit laggy (will fix if it becomes a problem for anyone)
- If the beatmap server is offline, the online beatmaps you download won't be visible from the CustomBeatmaps menu (you can still play them from the arcade).
- The OSU editor is currently semi-broken
